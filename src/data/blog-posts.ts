        'My dear readers, I must confess that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. There will always be vexation and grief, and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.',
        'I am not romantic, you know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\'s character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.',
        'Let us be practical in our pursuit of matrimony. A woman must secure her future while she has the power to do so. Youth and beauty fade, but a stable position in society endures.'

        'Marriage, my dear readers, is a business arrangement first and foremost. Let us not delude ourselves with notions of passionate love that novels so often promote.',
        'I have observed that those who enter marriage with the highest expectations often find themselves the most disappointed. Better to approach it with clear eyes and practical goals.',
        'Consider your position, your prospects, and your future security. These are the foundations upon which a lasting marriage is built.'

        'To love is to burn, to be on fire! How can one possibly consider marriage without the deepest feelings of love and devotion?',
        'I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both.',
        'Let others speak of prudence and practicality, but I shall never sacrifice the dictates of my heart to the opinions of the world.'

        'I once believed that second attachments were impossible, that the heart could love truly only once. How wrong I was!',
        'Love, I have learned, can grow quietly, steadily, like a garden tended with care and patience. It need not always burst forth like a sudden flame.',
        'To my dear readers, I say: keep your hearts open to the possibility of finding love in unexpected places and unexpected ways.'
