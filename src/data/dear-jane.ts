    subject: 'Should I Wait for True Love?',
    question: 'Dear Jane, I am twenty-seven and have received a proposal from a respectable gentleman. He is kind and well-situated, but I feel no passionate attachment. Should I accept for security\'s sake, or wait for true love?',
    answer: [
      'My dear Hopelessly Romantic,',
      'While the heart must not be entirely silent in matters of marriage, neither should it be the only voice in the conversation. Consider that happiness in marriage is not merely a matter of passionate beginnings, but of compatible temperaments and mutual respect.',
      'However, do not mistake mere security for contentment. A marriage without any affection is as imprudent as one based solely on passionate feelings. The ideal lies somewhere between Charlotte Lucas\'s pragmatism and Marianne Dashwood\'s romanticism.',
      'Examine your feelings carefully. Is your lack of passion truly indifference, or merely the absence of drama that so many mistake for love? Sometimes the steadiest attachments grow from the most modest beginnings.'

    subject: 'My Sister\'s Imprudent Attachment',
    question: 'Dear Jane, My younger sister has formed an attachment to a gentleman of questionable character. How can I guide her toward prudence without seeming to interfere?',
    answer: [
      'My dear Concerned Sister,',
      'Ah, the delicate art of sisterly guidance! One must tread carefully when matters of the heart are concerned, particularly when dealing with a younger sister who may mistake experience for interference.',
      'Remember how our dear Elizabeth Bennet handled her sister Lydia\'s situation. Direct opposition often strengthens such attachments. Instead, guide your sister to examine the gentleman\'s character through his actions rather than his words.',
      'Perhaps arrange situations where his true nature might reveal itself naturally. The best advice is often that which allows the recipient to believe they have arrived at the conclusion independently.'
